## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The mount is the second part of the Caster. The mount's dimensions are 120mm x 120mm extruded 8 mm. It has 4 holes 10 mm wide and 10 mm away from the wall's edge and 1 hole 25 mm wide in the center.

## Reflection
Something helpful and important to use when making the Mount is the Use tool. It is a cube on the tool bar and you can use it by selecting the edges and features you want to project into your new sketch. It was very helpful in making the process go much faster. 




## Fork

### Description
The fork is more complex and you need to know how to use more tools on Onshape in order to make it easily. Shortcut tools make this part go faster and easier to do.

### Reflection
Something I would recomend learning to use before making the Fork would be the Fillet and Chamfer. The Fillet tool is used to round and soften hard edges. The chamfer is used to make a hard edge sloped in a certain direction. The difference between the fillet and the Chamfer is that the fillet tool rounds lines and edges while the Chamfer tool is used to slope the line down from one line to another slightly down. 



## Tire

### Description
The tire starts with a simple trapezoid with the bottom's points 20 mm apart. The sides of the trapezoid are equal and the bottom left point is 10 degrees from the origin. There's a construction line from the origin going out to the right and the distance from the bottom right point on the trapezoid and reflected over that horizontal line is 80 mm. The distance from the top right point of the trapezoid is 110 mm reflected over the horizontal center line. You then revolve the trapezoid and fillet the edges 8 mm.

### Reflection
I wasn't sure how to get a degree dimension so I'll tell you how to.You need to click Dimension or use the shortcut by typing 'd' on the keyboard. First click on the bottom left point on the trapezoid, then click on the horizontal construction line coming from the origin. Onshape is smart and will realize what you are doing and make it a degree. Then proceed as you would a normal degree. 



## Wheel

### Reflection
I accidentally made my tire on the front plane instead of the top plane so when I went to make my sketch on the right plane for the wheel that I was going to revolve it didn't seem right. I noticed my mistake from the tire and instead of redoing it which would have been a huge waste of time, I clicked on the sketch and selected the front plane instead of the right plane so that the sketch was perpendicular to the tire. I did this so that it would fit inside the tire correctly. 
When cutting out the spokes it is a bit complicated but [following along with Mr. H's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbOjDNK8Nsk&feature=emb_title) made it easy.
